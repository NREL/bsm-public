# NEW USERS OF THE BIOMASS SCENARIO MODEL (PUBLIC VERSION) , PLEASE READ
==============================
## Development:

#### Project Team (by affiliation and alphabetical order):
Brian Bush, Daniel Inman, Yolanda Lin (formerly NREL), Emily Newes ([National Renewable Energy Laboratory](http://www.nrel.gov/) [NREL])
Steve Peterson ([Lexidyne, LLC]( http://www.lexidyne.com/))
#### Special Thanks: U.S. Department of Energy-Bioenergy Technologies Office, Alpha Testers, BSM team
#### Project Location and Funding
This model is formally named “Biomass Scenario Model” abbreviated “BSM”. The public version of the model (BSM-public) is distinct from the internal NREL version (BSM). It was built in Golden, CO within NREL's [Strategic Energy Analysis Center](http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/about_office.html)
This work was funded by the [United States Department of Energy’s](http://energy.gov/) [Bioenergy Technologies Office](http://www1.eere.energy.gov/bioenergy/) under Contract No. DE-AC36-08-GO28308 

## Licensing and Attribution:

The BSM-public is released under the [BSD license] (http://github.com/NREL/bsm-public) in this folder.

If you are using the BSM-public outside of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) BSM project, clearly distinguish your results (e.g., BSM-X, where X indicates your name or institution). The suggested citation is: National Renewable Energy Laboratory ([year]). Biomass Scenario Model, Public Version, Release [version number]. http://en.openei.org/wiki/Biomass_Scenario_Model.

For example:
In text: "BSM-X was developed from the public version of the Biomass Scenario Model, BSM-public (NREL 2017)." 
In references: NREL 2017. Biomass Scenario Model, Public Version, Release [version number]. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, Colorado. http://github.com/NREL/bsm-public.

Non-NREL users of the BSM-public should not attribute their results to the BSM-public. This is the case even if the model has not been changed. Attribution of non-NREL results to the BSM-public without modifying the name implies endorsement and is not allowed by the license. 

## User Guidance:

#### GitHub:
For directions on using GitHub, please see the GitHub guide available on the front page of your user profile.

#### Software and Capabilities:
Model saved in [STELLA Professional 1.4.1](http://www.iseesystems.com/softwares/Education/StellaSoftware.aspx). We recommend using version 1.4 or later.
See [ISEE Systems](http://www.iseesystems.com) for documentation and training related to the STELLA software.

#### Trial Version of STELLA Professional:
-    A trial version is available for free from isee systems, but changes to the model cannot be saved.
-    Changes to assumptions can be made in the user interface, and the model can be run with these changes.

#### Full Version Will:
-    Allow access to all the features of the BSM-public.

#### Wiki and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):
The BSM wiki is [here](http://en.openei.org/wiki/Biomass_Scenario_Model), and includes [Frequently Asked Questions](https://openei.org/wiki/File:Frequently Asked Questions.pdf).


#### Interacting with the BSM Development Team: User Community and Collaboration:

We welcome discussions of potential collaborations, and we are happy to make connections to develop cooperative analyses.

We are able to provide limited user support. We are unable to provide support to troubleshoot Github and Stella.

To contact the project team, please submit an issue ticket on this GitHub site, or contact bsm@nrel.gov.

#### Models and Data:

Located within [this](https://github.com/NREL/bsm-public/models) folder is the current public version of the BSM. A default input sheet is located [here](https://github.com/NREL/bsm-public/inputs). This input sheet will restore all default values to the model. It can be copied and modified to record other desired inputs. Please see the associated Readme file. For information about using input sheets, please see STELLA documentation. 

#### Model Testing:

[This](https://github.com/NREL/bsm-public/tests/studies) folder includes input sheets that are similar but not always identical to published simulations. Differences occur because publications may have used previous versions of the model.
