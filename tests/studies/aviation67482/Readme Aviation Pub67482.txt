This folder contains input files for BSM-alpha that correspond to some of the simulations displayed in the published report:

The image file in this folder "Aviation Biofuel Graphic with Run Numbers.png" corresponds to figure 3 in the report, and also shows run numbers.

The input files are named with the run numbers shown in the image. Input files are provided for the simulations that are outlined in red in the image. 

The published report used an earlier version of the BSM. There are several notable differences between the results in the published report and what these input files will show in BSM-alpha. We are still investigating these items.

1. Run number 190969 shows differences that we believe are caused by the change in simulation start year (from 2011 to 2015) and the new feedstock data. We are currently revising inputs to better deal with plants that started construction prior to 2015. We are also exploring why construction of new CHC facilities does not continue after 2032 in BSM-alpha whereas it did before.

2. HEFA totals are lower in BSM-alpha because we changed from an assumption that HEFA did not compete with biodiesel in the older version of BSM to explicitly modeling that competition in BSM-alpha.
