Click on the "+" sign.

Browse for the file.

Choose "Set parameters (will overwrite...)" as Import Behavior.

Choose "On Demand" as Link Type. [This option is not available if you have “Control variables” selected instead of “Set parameters (will overwrite...)"]

Choose "Horizontal" as Sheet Orientation.

Click "Import All"
